    <h2 class="des">Description</h2>
    <p>Pasta fagioli (or pasta e fagioli), which means "pasta and beans," is a traditional Italian soup. It consists of small noodles
     (such as ditalini or macaroni) and cannellini beans in a seasoned tomato broth.</p>
    <p>Since this is a hearty pasta soup, there's really no need to pair pasta fagioli with any side dishes. However, a complementary side salad or a slice of 
        crusty garlic bread will take this impressive dish over the top.</p>
    <h2 class="des">Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
